When working on a software project, integrating new features into the main branch requires carefully crafted pull requests (PRs). Each type of PR addresses different aspects of the codebase and ensures that new features are added smoothly without disrupting existing functionality. Here are the main types of pull requests that need to be done for the main branch, followed by examples of new features developed for a school exercise.

    Feature Pull Request: This PR introduces a new feature to the codebase. It should include detailed descriptions of the changes, how to test the new feature, and any relevant documentation updates.

    Bug Fix Pull Request: This PR addresses specific issues or bugs identified in the codebase. It should contain a description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, and the solution implemented.

    Refactoring Pull Request: This PR involves code improvements without changing its functionality. It aims to enhance code readability, maintainability, or performance.

    Documentation Pull Request: This PR updates the project’s documentation, which may include user guides, developer guides, or inline code comments.

Example Features for a School Exercise

Here are four features that could be developed and integrated into a main branch for a hypothetical school management system:

    Implementation: Adds a new interface for teachers to mark attendance, stores data in the database, and includes a reporting module.

PR Requirements:

    Description of the attendance interface.
    Instructions on how to test the attendance tracking functionality.
    Updates to the database schema and related documentation.

2. Online Assignment Submission

Feature Description:

    Purpose: To allow students to submit assignments online.
    Functionality: Students can upload assignment files, and teachers can download and grade them within the system.
    Implementation: Creates a submission portal for students, integrates file upload functionality, and adds grading features for teachers.

4. Timetable Management System

Feature Description:

    Purpose: To create and manage school timetables.
    Functionality: Administrators can create, edit, and publish timetables, and students can view their class schedules.
    Implementation: Adds a timetable creation tool, editing options, and a public timetable viewer for students.

PR Requirements:

    Detailed description of the timetable management tool.
    Steps to test timetable creation and viewing.

Conclusion

These types of pull requests ensure a structured and organized approach to integrating new features into the main branch of a project. Each PR type addresses specific needs, from adding new functionalities to fixing bugs and improving code quality. By following this approach, teams can maintain a high-quality codebase and deliver new features efficiently.
